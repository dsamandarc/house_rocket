## Business problem
As a Data Scientist at House Rockets, I am tasked with assisting the CEO in gaining a better understanding of our business. 
Our company acquires properties for the purpose of resale. 
The objective is to identify properties being sold at a low price in high-potential regions, where renovations can be made to increase their value for resale.
1. What properties should House Rockets acquire and at what price?
2. Once the house is acquired, when is the optimal time to sell it, and at what price?
