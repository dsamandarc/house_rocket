    "I´m a Data Scientist in a company called House Rockets. This company buy properties to resell. My objective is to help the CEO better understand the business: he needs to find properties being sold at a low price, in a good region, with high resale potential; reform and sell those at a higher price.\n",
    "The CEO have some business questions:\n",
    "1- What is the date of the oldest property in the portfolio?\n",
    "2- How many properties have the maximum number of floors?\n",
    "3- Create a classification for the properties that separate them into low and high standards (according to the price: High standard > $540.000 and Low standard < $540.000).\n",
    "4- Produce a report, ordered by the price and with the following information: id, date when the property stayed available, number of rooms, terrain size, price, property classification\n",
